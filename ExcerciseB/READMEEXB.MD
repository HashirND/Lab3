Documentation and Explanation

For this question I got my information from this website:
https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/backgrounders/parts-a-plant

In this it shows multiple levels of a plant, and since the requirement is 2 or more levels i went with 3.

Level 1 I chose Plant
Level 2 I chose Root system and Shoot System
Level 3 I choose Flower, Leaves, Taproot, Lateral Root, Flower, Leaf, and Apical Bud
